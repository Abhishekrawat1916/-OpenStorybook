The man came with a body-shop perfume so enthralling her nerves and she had just taken a bath.
Her body shimmering with hope and she was feeling more alive today after days of boredom.
His lips looked clever. He mapped his surroundings, a freshly cut rose bush in a corner, parallel mirrors flooding the room with sunlight. He was amazed how tiny the house was but when he looked at its owner the house felt propotionate. 

The man was wearing pans with belts on them and screwdrivers hanging to his sides. He asked
" should I explain the plans?"
she shrugged
"nope, I have already chosen them"
He insisted on initiating the conversation but she was not picking up any hints whatsoever
Then suddenly as if struck by a thought she asked him, 
"would you be using your hammer?"
He murmered yes
"where do you want the connection to be?"
She said righ here, pointing to the table she was standing next to"
He bent down to measure the length of the cable with a ruler that grazed against her legs causing a streak of red.
She hadnt felt the streak of blood trickling down her leg as it made its way to the marble floor.

He searched for pencil on the ground to mark the cable and noticed the red blood making its way towards him. 

He shouldnt have had done that, but it was by instinct that he cupped her leg to stop the bleeding.
