*thud thud thud*

“Get ready, Dru; we are leaving in 10 minutes”.
 His friend left after giving the final call.

On a typical day, Dru would be the one to get down the earliest, but today was different. He had been inside his room for more than an hour thinking about how he should behave, what he should wear, say, and whatnot. Why not, one would say. After all, the one who he has so publically admired had descended to this world on this very day. 

“We are leaving,” I shouted.

Disturbed by one last call, he shrugged his thoughts away and pulled on a light blue pullover, with cotton jeans to pair with. He left in a hurry, planning all in his head for one last time.
As soon as he stepped out, the cold wind smearing his cheeks justified his last-minute decisions. It was a cold wintery night of 31st, it was the time when people shared happiness together, a time when the sky was lit in beautiful colors, but most importantly, it was the night he was going to remember forever.
